The project is a comprehensive web-based platform for music teachers to manage their teaching business, focusing initially on teacher-side features with future expansion planned for student/parent features.

### Strategy Decision:
After evaluating all potential starting points, decided to begin with Market Analysis & Business Model because:
1. Need to validate market opportunity
2. Essential for guiding product and technical decisions
3. Critical for mapping path to $100mm goal
4. Will help identify key differentiators and pricing strategy

### Next Actions:
1. Begin competitor analysis
2. Define target market segments
3. Develop initial pricing strategy
4. Plan growth mechanisms

## Session 3 - App Structure Implementation
**Date**: February 17, 2024

### App Route Structure Setup
- Created separate `/app` route structure for the main application
- Implemented app layout with authentication protection
- Created initial dashboard page
- Maintained separation between landing page and app routes

### Implementation Details
1. Created new files:
   - `src/pages/app/layout.tsx` - Base layout for app section
   - `src/pages/app/dashboard.tsx` - Initial dashboard page
2. Updated routing in `App.tsx`:
   - Preserved landing page at root route (`/`)
   - Added `/app` routes under protected layout
   - Set up nested routing for app features

### Technical Decisions
- Using React Router's nested routing for app section
- Implemented basic authentication protection (redirect to home if not authenticated)
- Set up base layout structure for app section
- Created placeholder dashboard with key metrics

### Next Steps
1. Implement authentication system
2. Design and implement app navigation
3. Create remaining app features:
   - Lesson management
   - Student management
   - Resource library
   - Payment processing
4. Set up Supabase backend integration

## Session 4 - Authentication Implementation
**Date**: February 17, 2024

### Authentication Setup
- Integrated Supabase authentication
- Created auth context and provider
- Implemented protected app layout
- Added sign-in and sign-up pages

### Implementation Details
1. Updated `AppLayout`:
   - Added authentication check
   - Implemented loading state
   - Added sign-out functionality
   - Displayed user information

2. Created Authentication Pages:
   - Sign In (`/auth/sign-in`)
     - Email/password authentication
     - Error handling
     - Loading states
   - Sign Up (`/auth/sign-up`)
     - User registration
     - Basic validation
     - Profile creation

3. Authentication Flow:
   - Landing page remains accessible to all
   - App routes protected behind auth
   - Automatic redirection to sign-in
   - Session persistence

### Technical Decisions
- Using Supabase Auth for:
  - User management
  - Session handling
  - Secure authentication
  - Profile management

### Next Steps
1. Add email verification
