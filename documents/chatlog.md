# Project Development Chatlog

## Initial Project Setup - [Current Date]

### Context
Starting development of a Music Teacher Management Platform based on provided documentation:
- MVP specification detailing core features and requirements
- Technical decisions document outlining technology stack and architecture
- Project aims to be a $100mm potential application

### Key Documents Read:
1. mvp.md - Detailed MVP specification
2. tech_decisions.md - Technical architecture and stack decisions

### Technology Stack:
- Frontend: SvelteKit with Skeleton UI + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Supabase
- Database: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
- Deployment: Fly.io

### Initial Assessment:
The project is a comprehensive web-based platform for music teachers to manage their teaching business, focusing initially on teacher-side features with future expansion planned for student/parent features.

### Strategy Decision:
After evaluating all potential starting points, decided to begin with Market Analysis & Business Model because:
1. Need to validate market opportunity
2. Essential for guiding product and technical decisions
3. Critical for mapping path to $100mm goal
4. Will help identify key differentiators and pricing strategy

### Next Actions:
1. Begin competitor analysis
2. Define target market segments
3. Develop initial pricing strategy
4. Plan growth mechanisms
