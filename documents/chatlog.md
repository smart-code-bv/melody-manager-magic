# Project Development Chatlog

## Initial Project Setup - [Current Date]

### Context
Starting development of a Music Teacher Management Platform based on provided documentation:
- MVP specification detailing core features and requirements
- Technical decisions document outlining technology stack and architecture
- Project aims to be a $100mm potential application

### Key Documents Read:
1. mvp.md - Detailed MVP specification
2. tech_decisions.md - Technical architecture and stack decisions

### Technology Stack:
- Frontend: SvelteKit with Skeleton UI + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Supabase
- Database: PostgreSQL (via Supabase)
- Deployment: Fly.io

### Initial Assessment:
The project is a comprehensive web-based platform for music teachers to manage their teaching business, focusing initially on teacher-side features with future expansion planned for student/parent features.

### Strategy Decision:
After evaluating all potential starting points, decided to begin with Market Analysis & Business Model because:
1. Need to validate market opportunity
2. Essential for guiding product and technical decisions
3. Critical for mapping path to $100mm goal
4. Will help identify key differentiators and pricing strategy

### Next Actions:
1. Begin competitor analysis
2. Define target market segments
3. Develop initial pricing strategy
4. Plan growth mechanisms

2. Design and implement landing page
3. Plan core features for music education focus
4. Develop detailed technical specifications

## Session 2 - Technical Stack Investigation
**Date**: February 16, 2024

### Project Structure Analysis
- Investigated current codebase structure and dependencies
- Created comprehensive tech_stack.md documentation
- Identified key technical components:
  - React 18 with TypeScript as core framework
  - Supabase for backend services
  - Radix UI + Tailwind CSS for UI
  - TanStack Query for data management
  - Comprehensive form handling with React Hook Form and Zod

### Technical Architecture Overview
- Modern React-based frontend with TypeScript
- Serverless architecture using Supabase
- Emphasis on accessibility and developer experience
- Strong typing and validation throughout
- Real-time capabilities built-in

### Documentation Updates
- Created tech_stack.md with detailed technical documentation
- Documented project structure and key dependencies
- Outlined development workflow and tools

### Next Steps
1. Review existing features implementation
2. Identify any technical gaps or improvements needed
3. Plan technical implementation of remaining features
4. Consider scalability and performance optimizations

## Session 3 - App Structure Implementation
**Date**: February 17, 2024

### App Route Structure Setup
- Created separate `/app` route structure for the main application
- Implemented app layout with authentication protection
- Created initial dashboard page
- Maintained separation between landing page and app routes

### Implementation Details
1. Created new files:
   - `src/pages/app/layout.tsx` - Base layout for app section
   - `src/pages/app/dashboard.tsx` - Initial dashboard page
2. Updated routing in `App.tsx`:
   - Preserved landing page at root route (`/`)
   - Added `/app` routes under protected layout
   - Set up nested routing for app features

### Technical Decisions
- Using React Router's nested routing for app section
- Implemented basic authentication protection (redirect to home if not authenticated)
- Set up base layout structure for app section
- Created placeholder dashboard with key metrics

### Next Steps
1. Implement authentication system
2. Design and implement app navigation
3. Create remaining app features:
   - Lesson management
   - Student management
   - Resource library
   - Payment processing
4. Set up Supabase backend integration
